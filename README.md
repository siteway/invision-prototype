- [ ] Extract Data from:

Comment form BenNadel: 
>The exports were designed such that the data in the export is actually stored in a separate file (config.js). This is a JavaScript file (which I had to use in order to make it work on a user's local file system); but, the data is delimited by two comments, example:

<img width="1481" alt="1435ce9d-560f-442e-9b8e-25017d7a5f30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d3accc-8a0d-4fb9-b57c-a1dfcd84a851" />


>So, if you ever wanted to access the data using PHP you could read-in this file, extract the bits between the two comment land-marks, decode the hex-encoded characters, and then deserialize the JSON, and you'd have the data that is powering the experience.
